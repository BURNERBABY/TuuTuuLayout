# TuuTuuLayout
I want to create a a software for a project keyboard of mine that uses ai to swap between modes of layout based around arduino atmega 32u4 using qmk
Its only a slight issue such as no keyboard volume control when using tidal music streaming service but....i dunno, just gotta come up with something.

Its hard to say HOW as arduino needs some fancy stuff but i guess its possible

I also dont know for WHO but us custom mechanical keyboard lads are a weird bunch.

Absolutely nothing follows this

QMK is nice lol
